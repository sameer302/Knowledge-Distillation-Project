Of course. Here is a comprehensive project plan and methodology based on your project description.

This plan breaks down your project into distinct, manageable phases, outlines the required technologies, and provides a clear timeline to guide your team to a successful completion by the intensive assessment.

## Project Title: Resource-Efficient Knowledge Distillation for Multi-Domain Time-Series Forecasting

### **Objective**
The primary goal is to develop and implement a **knowledge distillation (KD) framework** to transfer forecasting capabilities from a large, complex, pre-trained "teacher" model to a much smaller and computationally efficient "student" model. The resulting student model should maintain high forecasting accuracy across diverse time-series domains (e.g., finance, healthcare, climate) while significantly reducing resource requirements like model size and inference time.

### **Phase 1: Foundation and Data Curation (Weeks 1-2)**

This phase focuses on gathering the necessary data and defining the criteria for success.

* **Task 1: Dataset Collection**
    * Identify and collect **4-5 multi-domain, multi-variate time-series datasets**.
    * **Suggested Domains & Datasets:**
        * **Finance:** Stock market data (e.g., historical prices of S&P 500 constituents).
        * **Climate/Energy:** The **ETTh1/ETTh2 dataset** (Electricity Transformer Temperature) is a standard benchmark.
        * **Healthcare:** Publicly available datasets like MIMIC-III (e.g., patient vital signs over time), or disease spread data.
        * **Web Traffic:** Wikipedia Web Traffic Time Series dataset.
        * **Air Quality:** Beijing PM2.5 Data.
    * **Action:** Preprocess all datasets: handle missing values, normalize the data (e.g., using Min-Max scaling or Standardization), and split them into training, validation, and testing sets.
    * **Verification:** Compile a list of chosen datasets with descriptions and preprocessing steps to be **verified by your TAs**.

* **Task 2: Performance Metrics Definition**
    * Define metrics to evaluate both model performance and efficiency.
    * **Forecasting Accuracy Metrics:**
        * Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$
        * Mean Squared Error (MSE): $MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$
        * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    * **Resource Efficiency Metrics:**
        * **Model Size:** Measured in Megabytes (MB).
        * **Inference Time:** Average time (in ms) to make a prediction on a single sample from the test set.
        * **Floating Point Operations (FLOPs):** A measure of computational complexity.
    * **Verification:** Finalize the list of metrics to be **confirmed with your TAs**.

### **Phase 2: Model Selection and Framework Design (Weeks 3-4)**

Here, you'll choose your models and design the architecture for knowledge transfer.

* **Task 3: Teacher Model Selection**
    * Explore state-of-the-art pre-trained models for time-series forecasting. These are often large Transformer-based models.
    * **Recommended Models:**
        * **PatchTST:** A simple but powerful transformer-based model that treats time-series patches as tokens.
        * **TimesNet:** A novel architecture that captures multi-periodicity by transforming 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors.
        * **Informer/Autoformer:** Earlier but still powerful long-sequence forecasting models.
    * **Action:** Select one teacher model. You may need to fine-tune it on your specific multi-domain training data to establish a strong performance baseline.
    * **Verification:** Present your chosen teacher model and the rationale for its selection to your **TAs for verification**.

* **Task 4: Student Model & KD Framework Design**
    * **Student Model:** Design a significantly smaller model.
        * **Examples:** A simple LSTM, a GRU, a smaller Transformer with fewer layers/heads, or a lightweight linear model.
    * **Knowledge Distillation Framework:**
        * The core idea is to train the student model to mimic the teacher's output distribution, not just match the ground truth labels.
        * The student will be trained using a loss function that combines the standard forecasting loss and a "distillation loss."
        
    * **Verification:** Create a diagram and a brief document explaining your KD framework design and student model architecture to be **verified by your TAs**.

### **Phase 3: Implementation and Training (Weeks 5-7)**

This is the core development phase where you'll write the code and train the models.

* **Task 5: Loss Function Design & Implementation**
    * Design a composite loss function to train the student model.
    * A common approach is a weighted sum of two components:
        $$L_{\text{total}} = \alpha \cdot L_{\text{task}} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot L_{\text{distill}}$$
        * $L_{\text{task}}$: The standard forecasting loss (e.g., MSE) between the **student's predictions** and the **ground truth**.
        * $L_{\text{distill}}$: The distillation loss. This measures the difference between the **teacher's outputs (logits)** and the **student's outputs (logits)**. A common choice is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence loss or a simple MSE on the logits.
        * $\alpha$: A hyperparameter (between 0 and 1) that balances the importance of matching the ground truth versus mimicking the teacher.
    * **Verification:** Formulate the final loss function and get it **approved by your TAs**.

* **Task 6: Model Training**
    * Implement the training pipeline in Python using a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
    * Train the student model on all datasets using your custom loss function.
    * Use tools like **TensorBoard** or **Weights & Biases** to log training progress, including loss curves and validation metrics. This will be your "training logs" deliverable.

### **Phase 4: Evaluation, Interface, and Documentation (Weeks 8-12)**

In this final phase, you'll evaluate your work, build the user interface, and prepare all deliverables.

* **Task 7: Evaluation and Visualization**
    * Evaluate both the teacher and the trained student model on the test sets for all datasets.
    * Collect the performance and efficiency metrics defined in Phase 1.
    * Create visualizations (e.g., using Matplotlib or Plotly) that overlay the **actual values**, **teacher's forecast**, and **student's forecast** on the same plot.

* **Task 8: Interface Development**
    * Use a simple framework like **Streamlit** or **Gradio** to build the user interface. Streamlit is highly recommended for its ease of use with data science projects.
    * **Interface Features:**
        1.  **File Uploader:** Allow users to upload a multi-variate time-series CSV file.
        2.  **Data Visualization:** Display interactive line plots of the uploaded time-series data.
        3.  **Forecasting Display:** After running the models, show the plot from Task 7 with clear legends for actual, teacher, and student forecasts.
        4.  **Metrics Dashboard:** Display a clean table comparing the Teacher vs. Student models based on the defined metrics (MAE, MSE, Model Size, Inference Time).

* **Task 9: Final Deliverables Preparation**
    * **Code & Models:** Organize your code into a clean structure. Save the trained model weights (for both teacher and student). Include a `README.md` file explaining how to set up and run the code.
    * **Stage-wise Report:** Write a detailed report that includes:
        * **Introduction:** Project objectives.
        * **Dataset Details:** Description of the datasets used.
        * **Methodology:** Detailed explanation of the teacher/student models, KD framework, and loss function.
