Of course. Finding good, clean, and diverse datasets is a critical first step. Here are some excellent sources and specific dataset recommendations, categorized by domain. These are all publicly available and widely used in academic research, making them perfect for your project.

### **1. General Repositories**

These are great places to start your search as they host datasets from many different domains.

  * **UCI Machine Learning Repository:** A classic, well-respected source for a wide variety of datasets.
      * **Website:** [archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  * **Kaggle Datasets:** A huge collection of datasets on almost any topic you can imagine, often with helpful notebooks and discussions.
      * **Website:** [www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  * **Google Dataset Search:** A search engine specifically for datasets.
      * **Website:** [datasetsearch.research.google.com](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com)

### **2. Specific Dataset Recommendations by Domain**

Here are some high-quality, multivariate datasets that are excellent for time-series forecasting projects.

#### **Energy & Climate**

These datasets are very common benchmarks for models like PatchTST and TimesNet.

  * **Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) Dataset:** This is arguably the most standard benchmark for recent forecasting models. It contains data from electricity transformers in China, including oil temperature and load.
      * **Features:** Multivariate (7 variables). Data is available at 15-minute and 1-hour intervals.
      * **Where to find it:** It's part of the Autoformer repository. You can download it directly from [**this link**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer%23data). (Look for ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2).

  * **Electricity Consuming Load (ECL):** Contains the electricity consumption of 321 clients.
      * **Features:** Highly multivariate (321 variables).
      * **Where to find it:** Also available in the [**Autoformer repository**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer%23data).

  * **Weather Dataset:** Records 21 weather indicators from the Max Planck Institute.
      * **Features:** Multivariate (21 variables), recorded every 10 minutes.
      * **Where to find it:** Also available in the [**Autoformer repository**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer%23data).



#### **Finance**

  * **S\&P 500 Stock Data:** A comprehensive dataset of historical daily prices (open, high, low, close, volume) for all stocks in the S\&P 500 index.
      * **Features:** Multivariate, daily frequency.
      * **Where to find it:** A well-maintained version is available on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500).

#### **Healthcare**

  * **MIMIC-III Waveform Database:** This is a very large and complex dataset containing physiological signals and vital signs from intensive care unit (ICU) patients. It's more challenging to work with but represents a real-world, high-stakes domain.
      * **Features:** Extremely high-resolution, multivariate time-series data (ECG, blood pressure, etc.).
      * **Where to find it:** Access requires registration and completion of a data use agreement due to patient privacy. [**PhysioNet Website**](https://physionet.org/content/mimic3wdb/1.0/).

  * **Daily Climate and Patient Visits:** A simpler dataset that links daily climate data to the number of patient visits for respiratory diseases in a hospital.
      * **Features:** Multivariate, daily frequency.
      * **Where to find it:** Available on [**Kaggle**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/damirpi/daily-climate-and-patient-visits-in-a-hospital).

#### **Web Traffic / Other**

  * **Wikipedia Web Traffic Time Series:** A very large dataset containing daily views for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles over two years.
      * **Features:** Highly multivariate, daily frequency.
      * **Where to find it:** Available on [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data).

### **Recommendations for Your Project:**

For your requirement of 4-5 multi-domain datasets, I would suggest the following combination for a strong and diverse set:

1.  **ETT (Energy):** A must-have benchmark. Start with **ETTh1**.
2.  **Weather (Climate):** Another standard benchmark that's very different from ETT.
3.  **S\&P 500 Stocks (Finance):** Represents a completely different domain with unique challenges like non-stationarity.
4.  **Daily Patient Visits (Healthcare):** A simple but effective dataset from the healthcare domain that is easy to get started with.
5.  **Electricity Consuming Load (ECL):** A great choice if you want to test your models on a dataset with a very high number of variables.

This collection gives you a fantastic mix of domains, frequencies (hourly/daily), and number of variables, which is perfect for testing the robustness of your knowledge distillation framework.
