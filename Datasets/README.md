**Description:** Data collected from from two regions of a province of China, named ETT-small-m1 and ETT-small-m2, respectively. Each dataset contains 2 year * 365 days * 24 hours * 4 times = 70,080 data point. Besides, we also provide the hourly-level variants for fast development (marked by h), i.e. ETT-small-h1 and ETT-small-h2. Each data point consists of 8 features, including the date of the point, the predictive value "oil temperature", and 6 different types of external power load features.

**Description:** The raw dataset is in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014. It is the electricity consumption in kWh was recorded every 15 minutes from 2011 to 2014. Because the some dimensions are equal to 0. So we eliminate the records in 2011. Final we get data contains electricity consumption of 321 clients from 2012 to 2014. And we converted the data to reflect hourly consumption.

**Description:** The raw data is in http://pems.dot.ca.gov. The data in this repo is a collection of 48 months (2015-2016) hourly data from the California Department of Transportation. The data describes the road occupancy rates (between 0 and 1) measured by different sensors on San Francisco Bay area freeways.
